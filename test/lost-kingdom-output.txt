Ramshackle Hut

You are standing inside your ramshackle wooden hut. The squalor here has
replaced the comfort and grandeur of your former royal palace. In one corner
near the north door leading to your garden lies the pile of straw you use as
a bed. Fixed in place by an unknown magic, next to a small table, is a wooden
mockery of your former throne. The main door to the east leads outside to a
road.

You can see:
  a small wooden box of matches sitting on the table (2)
